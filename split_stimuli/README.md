# split_stimuli

Materials for our talk on so-called "Split Stimuli" at Grammar and Corpora 2022 in Ghent. The term "split stimulus" has been used in the literature for cases in which the semantic stimulus of the experiencerâ€™s emotion appears to be "split up" between an NP and another phrase (usually a PP).
